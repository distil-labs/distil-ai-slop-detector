"Dear state senator, Many people believe that the Electoral College should be abolished, while others believe that the Electoral College should stay as it is. However, what most people who want to keep the electoral college, do not know is that when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Which means that the people do not get a direct vote towards the president. Therefore, it can cause disinterest in people who are eligible to vote. That is why I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

The first reason as to why I favor in abolishing the Electoral college is because you can not always trust the electors. As shown back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. Also, due to the winnertakeall system, candidates do not spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, it is obvious that they just want to win and you can not trust those candidates, especially the people who promise to do things they know they can not fulfill. The electors that ""the people vote for"" do not want to help their state, they do not even care for the needs of the people, they are just there for the money. Another reason as to why you can not trust the electors is because it is known that the electors can vote for whomever they choose and forget about the people's needs. One of the main reasons as to why this causes disinterest in potential voters. If the people vote directly for the president they have a better chance in speaking up and fighting for what they want therefore, trusting. Those are some of the rights that are taken away by the electoral college and people do not even realize it.

Another reason as to why I believe the electoral college should be abolished is because the electoral college is unfair to voters. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. That is more than half of the people! If the government really cared for what the people want, the electoral college would have been abolished by now. Studies have shown that only half of the people living in the U.S have voted in the pasts elections. If you really want the number of voters to increase and for citizens of the U.S to express their political preferences you should actually listen to them and abolish the electoral college.

Lastly, the electoral college prevents voters from controling who they vote for. Many voters now in days believe that when they vote, their one vote decides the election but, they are wrong. If they abolish the electoral college the voters would have a better chance in having who they want for president. The people who vote in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference we'll have more citizens voting if the electoral college is abolished.

"The breeze of the late summer air, it's fragrance of flowers and the occasional bakery wafting into our noses. The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coincided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.

To begin with, banning carsreducing them will benefit our ecosystems and environments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing Source 2. That CO2 rises into the air, the atmosphere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" We as a population don't have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of carpooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3 and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael siva brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, ""Mine 19 and 21 speaking of her children have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.

Alongside with the bettering the environment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the citytown. In Bogota, Columbia according to Source 3 new paths have been opening up, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city,"" stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.

In conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the environment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and checkup like oil leaks, motor mishaps. Think of this new world, it could happen with one voice.",human_written

"In the newer ages, people were worried about how they would get from A to B. They would have the curiosity of what others were driving, as of Mr. Sav ik in the article The End of Car Culture said when he was around twenty years of age. Most relied on cars because it was quicker or easier to have their own. They always thought about the disadvantages of not having a car but not the advantages. Helping the environment, saving money, and safety of others are all advantages of limiting car usage which citizens fail to realize.

To start off, limiting car usage helps the environment and helps keep it clean. In Europe passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Experts say that the the main cause of the greenhouse not being able to reduce gas emmisons is because of the tailpipe of cars driven around.

For example, Beijing,China is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris,France even banned cars for five days because the air pollution was so thick. They fined people for thirtyone dollars if they refused to leave their vehicle at home. Everyone wants to live as long as they can and to have a clean environment,so why not give up your car for a few days to help contribute.

Furthermore, everyone ould love to have a little more money in their pockets instead of putting it in their gas tank. Limiting car usage is the way to go if you want to save money. In Vauban,Germany you are allowed to have a car but it would cost you an arm and a leg just to have one. For car ownership there, you would have to buy a parking space for forty thousand dollars and a home.

As a result to having to pay that ridiculous amount of money for one parking space seventy percent of Vauban families do not own cars at all. Over fifty percent of the citizens sold their car before they moved there. Having that extra amount of money helps a lot.

Therefore, the safety for others is also an advantage of limiting car usage. If most of all the people are either walking or biking their way to their destination, no one would have to worry about getting hit by a car or getting into a car accident.

In German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars , Heidrun Walter explained how when she did have a car she would always tense up while drivng. Now that she doesn't have to worry about driving she is much happier with walking or riding her bike.

In conclusion, Helping the environment, saving money, and safety of others are just some of the advantages of limiting car usage. Their not only advantages but benefits to you as well. As said in the forth article, the percentage of people getting their licenses has dropped. The miles of driven by one person in 2013 was nine percent below the peak in January 1995. Slowly but surly the trend of not using a car is not blooming in the European countries but in the US as well.",human_written
"""The impact of renewable energy sources on our planet is undeniable. As we face the challenges of climate change, the transition to cleaner and sustainable energy becomes imperative.

Embracing sustainable practices and advancing technology in the renewable energy sector will play a pivotal role in creating a cleaner and healthier environment for generations to come.""",ai_generated
"Many citizens in the United States vote for whom they believe will achieve the goals and standards of serving as the U.S President. People think the process of voting is simple, but is it really? In the U.S, there is the Electoral College, which is'nt such a good thing for some people. That is why I'm in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States because voters can't control whom their electors vote for and the people in the U.S have a say of what goes on in their country, including the election of the president.

The Electoral College process allows citizens to vote for an elector in their state whom they believe will choose their preferred president. If the elector of their choice wins the statewide election with 87 votes, the elector votes for their preferred president along with the 87 votes. As stated in source 2 ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" When the elector votes for their preferred president, all the votes used on that elector counts for the president. Instead of going through this whole process, would'nt it be less of a struggle to just have citizens vote for the president of their choice and win by popular votes? Also stated in source 2 ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This shows how the Electoral College is difficult to understand for some people. The Unites States consists of many people who come from other counrties and speak other languages. This makes it even more complicated for some to understand even if the process is translated, and just by eliminating this process, it could make Presidential elections less complicated.

The U.S is different from any other place in the world. It is a free counrty! The citizens have a say in what happens in their counrty. The people make the decisions, the people vote for what they want and the people should be able to elect a president they believe will give them that! According to source 3 ""... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" Why can't the people be the electors? If the people in the United States don't have the freedom to vote for a president of their choice, what say do they really have? Electing a president is like raising money for charity, the president does all the work but all they money that is raised goes to charity the people. The people want someone who will help raise the money for them, not screw over their charity. Just like when signing up for a job the boss needs to see your resume, is like the people needing to see what the president can do to help their country. The citizens should be the ones making the decisions with help from the president that they believe could help with such decisions, not from electors who believe so.

Electing a president is very important to the country. Electing the president that people think could help support the U.S is also very important but very difficult as well. People should be able to easily vote for their preferred president with no difficulty, which happens to be caused by the Electoral College. By aborting this process, voters could control who they vote for and have a say in their country by voting for their preferred president. Having citizens tricked into voting for an elector is not the way to elect a president.",human_written
"""The discourse surrounding the ethical implications of genetic engineering has intensified as advancements in biotechnology open new possibilities. From gene editing to synthetic biology, scientists have gained unprecedented control over the building blocks of life. In this essay, we will examine the ethical considerations surrounding genetic engineering, exploring the potential benefits and the ethical dilemmas it poses.

Genetic engineering holds promise in addressing genetic disorders and enhancing human health. Techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 allow precise modification of genes, offering the potential to correct genetic mutations and eradicate hereditary diseases. However, the ethical implications of editing the human germline, affecting future generations, raise concerns about unintended consequences and the concept of ""designer babies.""

The agricultural sector has also embraced genetic engineering for crop improvement and pest resistance. While these advancements contribute to food security, questions about environmental impact, biodiversity, and the long-term consequences of genetically modified organisms persist.

Beyond human and agricultural applications, genetic engineering intersects with broader discussions about bioethics, consent, and the equitable distribution of benefits. Balancing the potential for scientific innovation with ethical principles requires ongoing dialogue and robust regulatory frameworks.

As society grapples with the implications of manipulating the genetic code, thoughtful reflection and responsible governance are essential to ensure the ethical and equitable advancement of biotechnology.""",ai_generated
"""The future of renewable energy is a topic of great importance as we strive to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the impacts of climate change. In this essay, we will discuss the potential of solar power as a clean and sustainable energy source.

Solar power harnesses the energy from the sun and converts it into electricity through photovoltaic cells. This technology has seen significant advancements in recent years, making solar energy more accessible and cost-effective. The use of solar panels on rooftops and in solar farms has become a common sight, contributing to a greener and more sustainable energy landscape.

One of the key advantages of solar power is its environmental friendliness. Unlike fossil fuels, solar energy production does not release harmful greenhouse gases, which are major contributors to climate change. By transitioning to solar power, we can reduce our carbon footprint and move towards a more sustainable and eco-friendly future.

In addition to its environmental benefits, solar power also offers economic advantages. The growth of the solar industry has created jobs and stimulated economic development. Governments around the world are incentivizing the adoption of solar energy through subsidies and tax credits, further promoting its widespread use.

While solar power has made significant strides, challenges such as intermittency and energy storage need to be addressed for it to become a primary energy source. Continued research and innovation in solar technology will play a crucial role in overcoming these challenges and unlocking the full potential of solar power.

In conclusion, solar power holds great promise as a clean and sustainable energy solution. As we continue to invest in renewable energy technologies, solar power will play a vital role in shaping a more sustainable and resilient future for our planet.""",ai_generated
"Dear state senator, I ask you to change the voting methods to popular vote instead of Electoral collage because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes focus more on those that have many Electoral collage votes and candidates for presidency dont need to be the most popular of all to win the presidency.

Candidates don't really care for small states with small population because they know that they don't matter in the result them being elected as president or not. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer ""Seventeen states didn't see the candidates al all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get so see a single campaign as. ""You may ask yourself why they didn't see any of of this well one thing that both of them share is that they dont have as many electoral collage votes as other states like california that has 55 electoral votes. And it's a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesn't get any votes at all.

You dont have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the presidency and its a winner take all. According to the ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the bestlaid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer ""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slater of electors, who in turn elect the president."" For example when bush was running for president he was not the most popular in the nation and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more then half the nation didn't want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote.

However According to ""In Defense of the Electoral Collage: Five reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner there is less likely to be a dispute over the electoral collage votes then in a dispute over the popular vote. It also requires a a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. ""The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

This is why I ask you state senator to change from Electoral Collage voting methed to The Popular voting to elect The President Of The United states Of America because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes and care more for those that do plus the candidate doesn't have to be the most popular in the to win the elections to become the President of the U.S.A.",human_written

"The automobile has been a staple in human history ever since it was first created, they have been used by people wether it was grocery shopping or during war. These days limiting car use has more advantages than ever. Such advantages are that it helps reduce the amount of pollution to the environment, helps people save money, swell as it helps people become more sociable and less stressed.

The limiting of car usage has many advantages one would be that it helps to reduce pollution caused by fuel emissions. Using vehicles creates green house emissions which cause the Earth to become hotter and then global warming becomes a big problem. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive area in the United States. So limiting car usage reduces the amount of emissions produced greatly. Smog is also a great threat to the environment, smog is created just like fog except polluted air gets into the mix of warm days and cold nights. Then instead of getting fog there is smog a more dense unhealthy version of fog. Paris has had a rough time when it came to smog which according to ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer resulted from the fact that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France.

Saving money is a big plus to the restriction on car use. With more buildings and shopping centers being built closer to suburban area makes walking a good way to save money. Andrew Selsky author of the article ""carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" made a comment on the situation in Bogota saying ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"". With more shopping centers for people to be able to reach by foot, bike, carpool, or bus can greatly reduce the amount people spend on gas and car repairs.

Limiting the usage of cars also in a strange way helps people become more connected with each other. Limiting car use will alow people to hang out more in things such as carpooling, bike rides, walking, public transportation. Allowing for people to meet more people. Also it wil allow people to use things such as social media to stil feel connected to their freinds without having to drive out to meet them. In another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""The End of Car Culture"" Rosenthal interviewed professor Mimi Sheller Who stated ""the rise iin cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arranments,includiong the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. The restriction on car usage allows for people to meet new people through the carpool service and such things.

"Automobiles have been all anyone talks about since the 1950s. With the creation of the Model T, songs that were sung of cars like ""Mustang Sally"", and providing transportation to millions across the globe, how could they not be controversial?. But shortly after 2005, driving has not been the peak of transportation. Many countries are banning the use of motorvehicles for multiple reasons and it may not be such a bad thing.

Recently, countries have been asking their residents to either take a day or two off from driving or give up their cars overall. In Vauban, Germany, 70 percent of the families do not own a car but rather they walk or bike everywhere. Residents say they do not feel stressed out so often and are no longer tense as they were when having a car. In Bogota, the people feel the same way. The Colombian city has had a ""Day Without Cars"" event for three years and most people really enjoy the relaxation you get from not driving a car everywhere you go. More and more countries and cities are implementing this idea.

One of the major priorities right now is air pollution from gas emissions and that is why countries are slowing down motorvehicle usage. In Paris 147 micrograms of particulate matter were found, 114 in Brussels and almost 80 micrograms in London. Most of that is because of driving. With diesel fuel ranking over gasoline, we are not getting anywhere. Countries in Europe and South America have put in fines and days that people are not allowed to drive because of how bad the smog is getting in some of the areas.

The next thing countries are trying to do is increase the number of alternative transportation. How long has it been since you rode a bike? Or walked to the nearest grocery store? With the decreasing amount of people using their cars, the amount of people riding their bike or going for a walk is exploding upwards. Since the 1990s, Bogota has constructed 118 miles worth of bike paths. Sidewalks were made to a higher quality, the parks attendance rates have rapidly increased and the shopping centers are shaped up very nicely now. All because of a few days without driving.

It may seem like a burden or even a bad idea in general but if we cut down the number of motorvehicles, we can save a lot of the beautiful parts of in world and install some new ones while we're at it. The fuel is hurting the environment and everyone should help out.",human_written
"We, the people of the United States, live in a car happy society. Every teenager can't wait until their 16th birthday because, for mostly every kid, that means that they go get their drivers license and possibly their very own car. Also, adults always look at getting a nice luxurious car and the top make and model of that year. Well, without a shadow of doubt, we should adopt the plan to cut down our usage of cars. It seems very successful considering 70% of vaughn's families don't own cars. It is detrimental to our country.

In case you haven't noticed lately but there is lot of pollution in the air.

According to article 1 , anywhere up to 50 percent of carintensive areas in the US make up the greenhouse gas emissions. It is depressing seeing all of this smog and pollution in the air everyday. Just a little heads up but the pollution increases every single day we use cars. It is a shame seeing such an extravogant and extraordinary country go to crap due to pollution. If you want to see how every state is going to look if we keep relying on cars then go to California and see how much of an eye sore it is. Cars are one of the major factors responsible for smog and pollution. Polution from your car can lead to animals dying and especially humans dying from your automobile.

People today care lot about making and having lot of benjamins . Everyone wants to be rich and have the most expensive types of stuff, lets face it who doesn't. If you cut back on putting money towards your car then that would save you a ton of money. Just imagine if you didn't own a car, think about all of the things you would't have to buy and pay for. Cars are expensive just to buy in the first place let alone having to pay for gas and maintain it and all of that stuff that needs to be done to it. Also say goodbye to the mechanic visits and having to deal with the stress that comes from them. It would cost less money to not own a car and just take city transportation via bus or taxi or even car pool. You could even go the healthy route and ride your bike or walk to places close by. There are many cheaper ways of getting places besides cars.

Cars can be very dangerous at times and driving can be as well. You are at a greater risk of getting into a car accident than getting into a bicycle accident. Car accidents happen everyday and most of the time they are fatal. Coming from personal experience trust me, being in a car accident is not fun and is really scary and nerveracking. It can also haunt you for the rest of your life. I almost lost my dad a couple years ago due to a terrible car accident that we were involved in that wasn't our fault. He hasn't worked since that day because he hasn't been healthy enough to do what he was doing. We both, still to this day, feel the gruling affects from that accident physically, mentally, and emotionally. It took a toll on us and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder what would of been if we didn't get into that accident. So wouldn't you feel more safe in a bus knowing that your less likely to get hurt than in a car.

Without question it is neccesary to cut back on car usage and start going green and using public transportation instead. Cars are a crucial part of our pollution today and that can easily change. All signs point towards the better option being to take a step back from cars for a little bit and see what the result is. Atleast once a week say that you can't use cars as transportation. This idea seems very good and well thought out and it will definetly show improvements that we want to see. So lets do it and see how much it affects our country.",human_written

"The electoral college is a process that supposedly helps keep this nation's voting under control, while infact the process of the electoral college is unfair to the states with a lower population because they have less of an input into the voting of the president with a lower number of electors available to vote for them. Also it is unfair to the people who want to be presidents because they mostly have a tie on the electoral votes and are elected on who wins the popular vote.

First off, having an electoral college in unfair to those states of lower population, take Minnesota for example, because they are only allowed 36 electors while bigger states, like California, are allowed up to 55 electors, In defense of the Electoral College: Map . Since most of the big states already have their votes planned out on who is going to win them over, presidenttobe's don't try to persuade them because they know they have those votes. Mostly they try to change the swing states, or the smaller states because they could change from Democratic to Republican during anytime in the election. If everyone had a say in the election, more people would be inclined to vote and there would be more input into who became the next 4 year leader of this nation.

Second of all, electoral colleges should change because for the last two elections, popular vote has been the deciding vote because the electoral vote has been a tie, In defense of the Electoral College: 2 Everyone's President.If we no longer polled electoral votes, citizens wouldn't have to take two votes, one on presidency and one on who they liked better. Presidents should be chosen on their stamina to change the nation for the people. Although some people still won't get what they want, the majority of the nation would be proud to support eachother in any of the changes the president makes.

In the world that is known, electoral colleges do make voting for the president a lot more controlled. But in the event that the elector is chosen and does not vote for whom he or she was elected by the people to vote for. What happens then? The wrong president is chosen because there was a fault in the system. This is called the disaster factor and it happened in the election in the year 1960 when Louisiana elected Democrats to vote against John F. Kennedy, who voted as Republicans against their state and voted forPresident Kennedy, The Indefensible Electoral College: What's wrong with the Electoral College.

After all, electoral colleges should be changed because it is better for the people so there is more of an input from smaller populated states, they will want to vote and there would be less of an ability to tie the election. Having a popular vote lets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already ""chosen"" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office. Last but not least, it is understood that having the electoral college decreases wrongdoings, but if the elector chosen by the state changes his intentions just for himself, that gives the state no word about it.",human_written
"Dear State Senator, I have realized that there has been debate lately about if we should abolish the Electoral College or not. Reading about this, you could swing either way and have a valid point, but I think my way has more valid points and makes more sense as a whole picture. The key here is the bigger picture because if you look at a small flaw of something for long enough it eventually takes up the whole picture in your mind. You may have your opions about it and I have mine but I would like to share mine with you so you can see why the Electoral College is still important and should still be used.

When our founding fathers sat down and decided to right up our federal government system, they argued emensly on voting and how it should go about. when they finished bickering and developed this system, they made sure everything had a checks and balances type of layout. With the Electoral College, "" you vote for the electors and they vote for president and vice president, and then congress counts the electorsial votes"". This idea is more beneficial then just having a majority vote for obvious reasons. With the electorsal votes and populous votes it makes it harder to choose a president just by a single vote advantage.

Now I know your probably yelling at this letter saying the disaster factor is the main problem with the electorsial college but let me finish. there have only been two times that this has happened. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes then bush yet fewer electorsal votes, but that was the first time since 1888"". If this has only happened twice then I think it is something that is fixable, but should not be the deciding factor that takes away the whole Electoral College system. The main reason we have this system is so there is a certainty of outcome and not just one score that is judged.

The way this is set up is so that ""no region has enough electorsal votes to elect a president"". This is a great thing because imagine if it was just majority vote the most populated states could just vote who they wanted to be president and it would be done. No other states would be able to compete and on top of that the candidates for president would only have to campaign in the populated states where they know they are already liked. The Electoral College is there so things aren't done in a jiffy. With this system the candidates actually have to work on trying to gain supporters in states where they may not be liked in. It also makes the American people think about all the options and decide on a bigger scale that requires more then just ""one vote"" to win an election.

Can you see why we need this Electoral College to stay and not just be abolished over like it is some plastic bottle on the highway that gets avoided and never gets picked up. We need people to stay actively involved in voting and I personally think the Electoral College does the best job with this. If the founding fathers spent months upon months just argueing about this single topic, I do not think they would just blow it off last second and come up with some giberish. If this system has worked this well this long then I think they must of done something right. Please consider my opinion state senator. ""Voters in presidental elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"".",human_written
"A decision tree, a prominent machine learning algorithm, structures decision-making in a tree-like model. Nodes represent decisions, branches signify outcomes, and leaves denote final decisions or predictions. The algorithm evaluates input features at each internal node, guiding the path to subsequent nodes until a leaf node is reached, yielding the final decision. This method accommodates both categorical and numerical data, offering interpretability through a visual representation. However, decision trees may suffer from overfitting, addressed through techniques like pruning and ensemble methods. Despite challenges, decision trees stand as versatile tools, finding applications in classification and regression tasks with a balance of simplicity and effectiveness.",ai_generated
"""The concept of time travel has long been a subject of fascination and speculation. While time travel remains a theoretical concept in the realm of physics, its exploration in popular culture has sparked imaginations and debates. In this essay, we will delve into the intriguing aspects of time travel, examining its portrayal in literature, movies, and scientific discourse.

In literature, iconic works such as H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"" have laid the foundation for imagining time travel. These narratives often explore the consequences of altering the past or future, raising questions about causality and the nature of existence. The portrayal of time travel in literature serves as a thought experiment, challenging readers to contemplate the implications of temporal manipulation.

In cinema, films like ""Back to the Future"" have become cultural touchstones, blending science fiction with humor and adventure. The visual representation of time travel in movies introduces concepts like parallel universes and alternate timelines. However, the scientific feasibility of time travel remains a subject of speculation, with theories such as wormholes and relativity offering hypothetical pathways.

While time travel captures the human imagination, the scientific community grapples with the complexities of its theoretical underpinnings. The concept of time dilation, as described by Einstein's theory of relativity, hints at the malleability of time under certain conditions. Nevertheless, practical applications of time travel remain elusive.

In conclusion, the exploration of time travel in literature, cinema, and scientific inquiry sparks curiosity and challenges our understanding of the nature of time. Whether confined to the realms of fiction or approached as a theoretical possibility, the concept of time travel continues to captivate minds and fuel intellectual exploration.""",ai_generated
"Cars, they make life so much easier, or, do they make them deadlier? The amount of green house gasses has increased dramaticly over the past years, due to the gasses emitted through the tallpipes of cars. However, there has been ways that people are trying to lower these gasses. People around the world are reducing the use of cars for a more cleaner form of transportation. In Vauban, Germany residents in this community ""have given up their cars""1. Also in Paris where they ""enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air""10. While in Bogota, Colombia they have a car free day to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog""20. These cities are pioneers in the way of a cleaner form of travel.

The first step is to just have a day without cars, like a new holiday. In Bogota, thats just what they have. On this day ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work""20, and those who didn't were fined. This reduces not only smog but the stress of driving and the business of traffic jams. On one of these carfree days, even though it was raining the spirits of the people didn't dampen. Enrique rivera, the mayor of Asuncin, Paraguay, said ""these people are generating a revolutionary change and that it is crossing borders""26, when he visited Bogota. As a result of these days ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restraints and upscale shopping districts have cropped up""28.

Another way that the carfree idea is shaking up is in Paris, France. On a Monday ""motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home""11, if they didnt they would recieve a 22euro fine. There smog riviled Beijing, ""known as one of the most polluted cities in the world""14. however, after only one day, ""the smog cleared enough on Monday that the ruling French party rescinded the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday""19.

The biggest leap, however, would be a town with no cars. Vauban, Germany is a community where ""street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden""2. The streets are filled with ""the swish of bicyles and the chatter of wandering children""3 instead of motors and horns. This expirimental town has sparked a new way of life a cleaner, safer way of life.

We have gone on thousands of years without cars, and after they were introduced they polluted the air and caused us stress. So if we could go on without them before, then why can't we now. As demostraighted by Paris, Bogota and Vauban life isn't that bad without a wheel to sit behind.",human_written
"Deaor Mor. Senatoor, What is the Electooral College? Can voteors contorol whom theior electoors vote foor? Not always. The Electooral College is an unfaior, outdated, and iororational porocess. Although many believe it is a necessity foor choosing a poresident, it is not. I believe the porocess of choosing a poresident should be changed to the election by populaor vote in the United States.

Fiorst, what is the Electooral College? In the passage ""What Is the Electooral College"" it says, ""It is a porocess by which the founding fatheors established in the Constitution as a comporomise between election of the Poresident by a vote in Congoress and election of the Poresident by a populaor vote of qualified citizens. The poresidential election is held eveory fouor yeaors on the Tuesday afteor the fiorst Monday in Novembeor. You help choose youor state's electoors when you vote foor youor Poresident because when you vote foor youor candidate you aore actually voting foor youor candidates electoors."" But, little did the fouding fatheors know it is not oreally a comporomise. The Electooral College is composed of 538 electoors.Some of them unfaior ones too. A majoority of 270 electooral votes is orequiored to elect the Poresident. In souorce 2 it says, ""The poresidential election is held eveory fouor yeaors on the Tuesday afteor the fiorst Monday in Novembeor. You help choose youor state's electoors when you vote foor youor Poresident because when you vote foor you or candidate you aore actually voting foor youor candidates electoors."" Second, the Electooral College is not a place, it is a porocess, an unfaior, outdated, and iororational porocess. Accoording to the passage ""The Indefensible Electooral College"" it states how, ""Undeor the Electooral College system, voteors vote not foor the poresident, but foor a slate of electoors who in tuorn elect the poresident."" Do you think that is faior? This porocess is confusing and it should be abolished. Due to the Electooral College many people get confused and sometimes vote foor the worong candidate. In the souorce ""The Indefensible Electooral College"" it says, "" faithless electoors have occasionally orefused to vote foor theior paorty's candidate and cast a deciding vote foor whomeveor they please."" That is unfaior, and iororational. People should be able to have a choice, although they let you feel like you'ore doing something by voting, you actually aore not doing much. The Electooral College gets the last woord.

Thiord, some aorgue that the Electooral College has good intentions, they suppoort theior claims with ideas stated in the passage ""In Defense of the Electooral College"" some such as ""The Electooral College orestoores some of the weight in the political balance to laorge states, the Electooral College orequiores a poresidential candidate to have toransoregional appeal, oor the Electooral College avoids the poroblem of elections in which no candidate orecieves a majoority of the votes cast."" Although these oreasons may be valid, they'ore not enough to puorsuade thousands of U.S citizens that the Electooral College should not be abolished.

Cat got youor tongue? In conclusion, as you can see the Electooral College is not always the best way to choose a poresident, it is unfaior, it is outdated since the founding fatheors had set it up, and it is iororational. the Electooral College should be oreplaced with the porocess of populaor vote.",human_written
"Todays society uses automotive vehicles almost everyday. When they go to work, to go to school, to go shopping, for fun, or anywhere they wanna go. Smog has been building up from the cars pollution for a very long time. Using Vehicles less will decrease smog, improve people's health, an will be better for the earth. Using automotive transportation less will help everyone an everything in the whole world from humans to the air we breath, from animals to the grass they eat.

However, using vehicles less will decrease the smog amount all around the world. Smog affects everything so decreasing it will help everyone an everything out greatly. Banning cars for a day or banning oddnumbered plates for just one day would help out tremendously. In France they have banned oddnumbered an evennumbered plate numbers for one day each on different days. "" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban for oddnumbered plates on tuesday."" So even banning vehicles one day can have a huge impact on decreasing smog. An it also clears up congestion on the roads.

However, by using automotive transportation less it will improve people's health. Walking, skateboarding, riding bicycles, or running will all improve your health. If you had to go somewhere you could walk there an it would improve your cardio. If you do this in a large city for one day a great majority of people would participate. ""In Colombia, a program took place an millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work."" That would greatly take a impact on the smog ratio. And all of those millions of people who participated got plenty of excessive for the day to improve their health.

So, by using automotive vehicles less it would tremendously help the entire Earth. Smog affects pretty much everything. The air that all the humans and animals breath in is polluted. The air is polluted so it affects the grass an vegetables that animals an humans consume for energy. It affects the trees that give off fresh oxygen so we can continue to breath. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Not driving would take away traffic jams therefore, people would not stress as much an also traffic jams cause a gigantic amount of air pollution so not driving would greatly help the entire Earth that we live on.

In conclusion, using automotive transportsation less would greatly help reduce smog build up, improve everyone's health, and it would tremendously help the Earth. It would lower air pollution so that the air we breath in would not be harmful to us. Even if we just banned cars for one day the whole Earth would be a lot cleaner. In the U.S the numbers of miles driving peaked in 2005 an have dropped stedily since then. People are starting to drive less and less an it is greatly helping the entire world.",human_written
"Dear, Mr.Mrs. Florida state senator I am writing to you about the Electoral College and i would like to share my opions with you. As we know the Electoral College chooses the president by having 538 electors and the winning president must have at least 270 electoral votes to claim the presidency. States get a number of electoral voters and depending on the size of the state depends how many voters that state gets, bigger states get more electoral voters and smaller states for example Rhode Island get less. The way the Electoral College is set up it seems that the menwomen running for presidency would try to get the minds of the bigger states with more electoral voters to choose them so they can reach the 270 mark. It is clear to me that we have done it this way ever since the founding fathers created it. Its time for a change, the Electoral College is out of date and needs to be replaced with popular vote. Lets not forget the 2000 election when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost because of the Electoral College, Al Gore quite frankly should have won, I mean he did have more votes.

The Electoral College is a system that doesn work, popular vote on the other hand does work. If the United States of America wants a ""fair"" election then we should give them one with the popular vote. It is simple and easy to understand, the madwoman with the most votes wins the presidency. Its time to let the Electoral College go byebye, the 538 electoral voters need to leave and make room for a more efficient election. Most Americans are done with the ""winnertakeall"" style, if we can let the Electoral College go we can have more ""fair"" elections, not ""winnertakeall"" elections. Sometimes though even the electoral voters don't even vote for who won that state they also vote for whom they want to be president. The Electoral College is not efficient, in ""1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election,"" and again in 1976 a tie could have happened if some voters voted the other way, in that case they were only a few votes away from a disaster. If we have the popular vote then candidates would try to get everyone from every state, but with the Electoral College some candidates dont even visit a state or a region they know they won't win over. So that means they will try the bigger states or a region they came from with that said its unfair to the voters.

The Electoral College is a good way for the voters within the college to cheat their way into having the candiate they want to win, win. So if this country wants a more fair vote every four years on a Tuesday after the first Monday then we must have popular vote.

I hope you will take my facts and opions into consideration and give it time to think and discuss what you think, but if everyone wants a more fair election I say we give them one.

Thank you for your time, from: a student from a high school.",human_written
"The debate on the pros and cons of car usage has been an ongoing one. Slowly, the advantages are beginning to outweigh the disadvantages. Around the world, projects and programs have been started to test the effects of limited car use. Data has proved that limiting car usage will cause less pollution, less stress, and less traffic.

To begin with, gas released from our cars has slowly started to hurt us. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""source 2. This shows that the gas in our cars is one of the factors responsible for the growing pollution in our air. Reducing the usage of cars will not only benefit us, but also the world we live in.

In addition, almost everyone knows what it is like to be stuck in traffic. The stress inducing event must not be healthy either. By declining the use of cars, congestion will slowly diminish. Promoting other ways of transportation will improve health, mood, and traffic. ""rushhour restrictions have drastically cut traffic""source 3.

Furthermore, a large portion of our population are constantly stressed. Car usage is accountable for a good amount of it. ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" source 1 says a citizen of a ""carfree"" community. By limiting car usage, healthier ways of transportation are encouraged. For example, hiking, biking, skating, and walking. All of these are extremely healthy compared to sitting in a car. Due to the fact that the United States is the country with the fattest people, these methods should be enforced. Healthy people then start to become happier. Therefore, reducing car usage will benefit our people's lives.

Hence, limiting car usage will create a better environment for people all around the world.",human_written
"Cars most people use them for transportation. It's our lazy way of getting to places.

Automobiles benefit us plenty when it comes to getting from point A to point B, but they also have a big negative impact. Cars are responsible for a huge amount of pollution like greenhouse gas emissions and smog. If we were to limit car usage, we could decrease the amount of stress and pollution emitted into the air, as well as give our community a chance to improve.

In Vauban, Germany, residents have given up their cars and have no problem doing so. Cars are generally not allowed, forbidden some would say, in this district. vaughn's streets are pretty much ""carfree"". Of course car ownership is still allowed, with the exception that you have to be able to find a place to park since there are only two places large garages at the end of the development, where a carowner can buy a space for 40,000, along with a home. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Heidrun Walter stated, a mother of two. Experts say automobiles are a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Paris participated in a driving ban, which violators suffered a fine of 22euro31. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, for example, last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter while Brussels had 114 PM and 79.7 PM in London. Since Paris participated in this ban, 60 percent of Paris' smog has cleared.

In Bogota, Columbia, the city held a carfree day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third year in a row cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted to this Day Without Cars. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog as well. Violators here faced 25 fines. Even with occasional bad weather, people still participated in this event. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man, as he rode a twoseated bicycle with his wife. The Day Without Cars allowed parks and sports centers to bloom, uneven sidewalks to be replaced wih broad smooth sidewalks, new restaurants and upscale shopping districs to crop up, and rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

In the United States, Americans are starting to buy fewer cars, drive less, and get fewer licenses as each year passes partially because cashstrapped Americans couldn't afford new cars. If this pattern continues, which many sociologists believe, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment. Even though reducing automobile transportation could have negative implications for car industries, the positive affects are much more important. In this generation, the internet allows people to connect without having to drive to meet friends. At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedesrtian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" In conclusion, cars are starting to be less and less of a neccesity, and more and more people are starting to notice that automobiles are just hurting the enviornment. By limiting car use, it can limit stress, help the enviornment as well as communities to improve, save time, conserve resources and improvee safety. There are plenty of other ways to get transportation that are less damaging and dangerous, like bicycles and walking. Of course it may take a little longer to get places without a car, but you can always ride a bus, or enjoy the scenery while riding a bike or walking.",human_written
"The Electoral College should remaining our countries voting system when deciding whom the president of the United States will be. The Electoral College is a process our founding fathers established as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote made by citizens Source 1, paragraph 1. Citizens elect electors who will then elect the president. This system is affective in many ways and shall not be abolished. These electors are conscious of every decision they make when deciding on our president and are here to look at things we may overlook. They are here to help us make the most affective decision. adderall, this is an enormous decision. It is the decision of whom the president of our country will be.

The Electoral College has 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President Source 1, paragraph 3. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment."" This lists the candidates whom ran for president in your state and the names of their respective electors. It is a well organized and thoughtout process. This process helps us make the best decision as a country on whom our future president will be.

In source 2, paragraph 13, it states ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning in."" Candidates don't take their time in these states because they don't want their beliefs and ideas shut down. They spend some time in these states. The electors for each state help them vote wisely, therefore the absence of presence by these candidates should not be a big ordeal. People want to abolish the Electoral College due to citizens not being able to vote for the president yet they do not realize what this system has provided for us. It provides organization and avoids many, many problems that would likely take place without the Electoral College.

In source 3, paragraph 20, discusses how voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign due to the fact they have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates. These voters are the most thoughtful and should be the ones deciding the election. Also, in paragraph 22, also in source 3 it states how there is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. That pressure is reduced by the Electoral College because it produces and reveals a clear winner.

The Electoral College was created many years ago and has brought organization to our voting system. Why should we try to fix something that is not broken? Changing the system would be illogical. Electors are wiser at making these final decisions than we are. Wwe deserve an input, which we can all agree we recieve, but we shouldn't make the final decisions of our country aimlessly. Electors are people who know exactly what to look for in a president and they are more knowledgable on the subject.

"""India, a kaleidoscope of cultures, traditions, and histories, is a country that fascinates and intrigues. As the world's largest democracy and a rapidly growing economy, it presents a unique tapestry of diverse landscapes, languages, and lifestyles, making it a land of contrasts and contradictions.

At its heart, India is known for its rich cultural heritage that spans thousands of years. Home to ancient civilizations, it has been a melting pot of religions, arts, and philosophies. The country's architectural wonders, like the Taj Mahal, the ancient temples of Varanasi, and the royal palaces of Rajasthan, are not just tourist attractions but symbols of its rich history and artistic prowess.

India's diversity is also evident in its people and languages. With over a billion inhabitants belonging to various ethnic groups and speaking more than a thousand languages, India exemplifies unity in diversity. Each region boasts its own unique traditions, festivals, and culinary flavors, contributing to the country's vibrant and dynamic character.

Economically, India has undergone significant transformation, evolving from a primarily agrarian society to a modern, tech-savvy nation. It has become a global hub for information technology and software services, with a burgeoning middle class driving consumer growth. However, this rapid development coexists with challenges like poverty, inequality, and environmental concerns, reflecting the complexities of modern India.

India's natural beauty, from the Himalayan peaks to the tropical coasts of Kerala, adds to its allure. Its national parks and wildlife sanctuaries are home to an array of biodiversity, including the majestic Bengal tiger.

"Cars are great, you can get from one point to another in a short amount of time, but are they really necessary? After all we have public transportation, bicycles, and our own two feet.

The advantages of car usage can be picked up by other forms of transportation, and the environment can be saved at the same time. If car usage was limited the world and its people would be much better off. There would be less pollution, a drop in the number of people diagnosed with diabetes, less accidents, and over all a healthier planet and world population.

There would be less pollution because if car usage was limited then there would be less pollutants from the gas in cars going up into the air. Source 2 provides evidence of this, from ""...days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Duffer 10 to ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Additionally many people are content with not having a vehicle, or even a licence in some cases, as shown in Source 1, 3, and 4. In Source 1 Heidrun Walter explains her view on not having a car after previously owning one, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source 3, shows his support unlimited car usage by saying how it helps the environment and the health of the people in reducing stress, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In Source 4 Elisabeth Rosenthal speaks of how her own children and Mr. Sivak's son, all avoid using cars and Rosenthal's children don't even have licenses and they are 19 and 21 years old.

The health of the people in our world would improve and there would be less people diagnosed with diabetes because they would likely get more exercise. With limited car usage people would have to find other ways of transportation, which includes bike riding, skating, hiking, or public transportation. While using public transportation would not help to improve the health of the people, biking, skating, and hiking would, as some people do these things just for exercise. So if people were forced to do one of these alternative forms of transportation, they would be exercising and getting from point A to point B all in one shot.

Not only would limited car usage help peoples health by making them be more active, but it would also help by providing cleaner air. Poluted air can cause health problems, especially in the lungs, if car usage was limited, then polution would go down, so people would be breathing fresher air that would cause less lung damage.

There would be less accidents because there would be less cars on the road. The majority of the vehicles on the road would likely be public transportation too, so the drivers may be more cautious than the average driver since they have the lives of many people in their hands.

The world would be a safer and healthier place is car usage was limited.",human_written
"Cars have been used for a very long time now and are a revolutionary invention that completely changed the way humans lived, since it became easier to move from one place to another and increase the size of our cities and mobility in general. Automobiles have always been extremely useful and necessary to our society, however, it had too, some significant disadvantages that could have great impact on our lives. Having this clear now we can point out the advantages of limiting the car usage no matter how hard or difficultt it might be to the biggest cities or more developed societies.

It is important to notice an experiment that was conducted in Germany, the city of Vauban was finished in 2006 and it is an example of a ""carfree"" environment with a few exceptions such as the main street and borders, according to Elizabeth Rosenthal in her article: ""In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars"". In the passage it is explained how people gave up a certain lifestyle to participate in this new progect and it proves how limiting the usage of car can create a very successful and less stressful future. 70% of the population of this city do not own cars, one of them, Heidrum Walter said: ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way,"" proving again how advantageous is this experiment.

In the other had, there is France's capital Paris, which banned driving due to smog. ""Diesel fuel was blamed"" expressed Robert Duffer on his article, additionally referring to its use which makes up 67% of the vehicles in France. As a result of the fines and free public transportation on business days the smog cleared enough so part of the ban was rescinded. Another example of the advantages of reducing car usage is how ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" added Carlos A. Plaza, a colombian participating in the carfree day that takes place in Bogota every year. This event motivates people not just in the Colombian capital to ride bikes and be healthier but everyone around them, including adjacent southamerican countries. For instance, statistics talk too, and it is possible that America getting over its obsession with cars, which is amazing news due to the fact that mobiles vehicles represent the second largest source of carbon emissions in America, as discused on ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal.

All in all, limiting car usage although a difficult decision for most residents of developed firstworls countries might just be one of the greatest steps we could take towards helping our envirionment and forging a new society, shaping it a better way, building healthier kids that will excersice and ejoy more the outsides, and that will breathe cleaner, fresher air.

While a president can get the majority of the popular vote on the other hand, he could have the minority of the electoral college votes. That president would lose the election even though he technically had the most votes. We should change the process into popular votes for the president.

The electoral college can or will defy the will of the people. The article ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted ,Back in 1960,segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose Jhon F. Kennedy.So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.The election whould have gone the other way if the due to the electoral college. The electoral college are way too risky to take on. just simply couple of unwilling electors can change the tide of the election.

The electoral college is a unfair process because of the winnertakeall system. In the article called What Is The Electoral College"", by the office of the federal register it quoted most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral college is a unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is a unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slightly change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.

In conclusion,The electoral college is a unfair process that has cause presidential election to change. The best results for electing president is by the popular vote. Obviously popular votes sounds more efficient and a clean election. The winnertakes it all process counterfits the number of american citizens voting result. Eletoral college process is an extra step to the election with more problems than barely any benefits. Electoral college should be change and alter in to a different process with clean votes that'll actually be fair for once.",human_written
"Eyeglasses, a revolutionary invention dating back to the 13th century, have profoundly impacted human lives by correcting and enhancing vision. Comprising lenses supported by frames, eyeglasses address refractive errors, aiding those with nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Over the centuries, eyeglass design has evolved from rudimentary spectacles to a diverse array of styles and materials, meeting both functional and aesthetic needs. Advancements in lens technology, including bifocals and progressive lenses, have catered to multifocal prescriptions. In addition to vision correction, eyeglasses have become iconic fashion accessories, influencing trends and personal style. As technology progresses, innovations like photochromic lenses and blue light filters address contemporary visual challenges. Eyeglasses stand as a testament to the seamless blend of utility and fashion, enriching lives by providing clearer vision and self-expression.",ai_generated
"Here, in the United States, birthplace of the Model T,driving has proven to be part of our history and culture. However, with recently uncovered developments in our environment such as global warming and pollution, it is time for us to reevaluate our ""car culture"". Overusage has proven harmful and limiting alternatives that reduce stress, are just as effective in getting us from point 'A' to 'B' and are more ecofriendly.

Our excessive car usage is dramatically hurting our environment. In fact, ""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" 5. What people use for our short term convenience is actually proving inconvenient for us in the long run. In Paris, there was ""147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London"" 17. The culprit? Diesel fuel emissions from transportation cars. To underscore the severity, the smog in Paris is so bad that French Officials had to limit car usage in a smog cloaked city that ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world""14.

This issue is mirrored in Bogota, Columbia, where the government has also stepped in and established a car free day in which perpetrators get fined in order to "" promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" 21. Efforts such as these can be effective in aiding our environmental crisis. After France also instate a limit on car usage ""the smog cleared"" 19. By limiting our car usage we can actually make a difference in reducing pollution and make our living environment more pleasant and healthier.

The switch is facilitated further not only by the inclination toward a better worldy environment but a less stressful social one as well. In the city of Vauban in Germany, residents have "" given up their cars""1. Here although car ownership is allowed, ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there."" 3. Do the residents regret their decision? According to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two: ""When I had a car I was always tense, I am much happier this way""3. In Bogota, a business man, Carlos Arturo Plaza who participates in Bogota's movement to reduce car usage says that the absence of cars is an ""...opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" 24. These are two individuals on different continents with families and busy lives who find the lack of cars to be not a handicap but actually a source of stress relief. In France, after the restrictions of car usage the streets also became less stressful for people who have to drive like taxi drivers or public transporters because of a ""60 percent reduction in traffic congestion"" 14.

For those who do decide to make a move to help the environment and themselves by reducing their car usage, their are more and more alternatives that are making their switch worthwhile. In Vauban, you can hear the sounds of viable alternatives in use. The ""swish of bicycles"" and the ""chatter""3 of walking children is audible in the streets. Carlos Arturo Plaza rides the carfree streets of Bogota on "" atwo seat bicycle with his wife""24. For those who don't feel comfortable with walking or cycling other options such as carpool exist and governments are now making more of an effort to make other alternatives such easier and more available i. e. public transportation. In Bogota, in order to support the movement toward less automobile driving wide sidewalks have been made. In Vauban the whole city has been constructed with the goal to make everything compact and easier to access by foot or bike. This is good news for those who make the early morning busness commute as their job is closer to where they live and more convenient to walk or bike to than other suburbs in which commuters are forced to take the high way because of the distance. Also, the more people who take advantage of whatever public transportation available to them will make the demand higher and cause more funding to be placed on public transportation. Before ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to high ways and only 20 percent to other transport""9, but with more usage, this can change.

Essentially, the sacrifice of some of our car usage is far outweighed by the positive affects on our environment and attitudes.",human_written
"when looking at the world from a birds eye view, it is possible to see the beauty in the world Even so, in certain developed and developing areas, the people are choking. The choking is not just supported by the violated environment, but along with that, society is an advocate for the pain of the people. An intrugal part of the current society is the usage of cars. With the progressing world also comes regress, and according to an article written by the New york times in 2013, it was stated that in countries such as the United states of America, ""Americans are buying less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This eventually has lead to a limiting in car usage in the U.S.A. Although the car industry may suffer from this, it is essential to note that, the limiting in car usage does not really have a negative impact on the public. In fact, in the long run, the limiting of car usage will be beneficial to society as a whole. This can be seen in three major ways, with first, public benefits , second, cheaper and timesaving methods , and finally the unmatched environmental benefits.

As people continue to choke from the pain, it becomes important to identify the remedy to the problem, and limiting car usage is the definitely one of the best ways to reduce the harms. The public benefits can be broken down into reduced stress , more space , and increased safety. Starting off with stress, Heidrun Walter, a mother of two children stated that she was ""always tense"" when she had a car. she now lives in the German city of Vauban. Here most people have given up on cars, including Mrs. Walter. As a mother of two she ultimately is a strong advocate of car usage limitation. With Mrs. Walter, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". These people have already felt their stress decrease with the limitation of car usage and this is a major benefit. Moving toward space, an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal in 2009, states in this new approach, we will have make it so there is less space for parking. With less space for cars, there is more space for people. Not only that but with the increased limit, there is a decrease in traffic. Traffic can be extremely long, and in this case it will help to increase public space. Although traffic does not pose threats to the people safety, in the long term car accidents do pose a major threat. Therefore, with their limit, there can be an increase in safety for the people. Moving back to Mrs. Walter, she as a mother of two did want the best for her children, and above all comes their safety. Meaning that her choice can also reflect the safety that this limitation produces.

Although people do want to benefit as individuals, it really comes down to the cost at the end point. But limiting car usage is actually not that expensive to the average person. In fact, by limiting cars, alternate transportation is promoted. Countries such as Colombia, have move on to bicycles. The major of Bogotaa city in colombia said that due to the limitation of cars for a day ""It has seen the constuction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"". This is cheaper because the prices og bicycles are pale in comparison to cars. This means that transport would be so much more affordable. Now with the increase in bicycle travel, there would hardly be any large amounts of traffic. And although cars are much faster than bicycles, the fact that traffic will be a major factor in travel, bicycle travel will be more efficient. This ultimately means that by limiting car usage, transportation will be cheaper, and it will be just as efficient, if not more. It can be said that it would be difficult to manage bicycle travel, but David Goldberg, an offical of transportation for America said that in countries such as the U.S.A. 80% of appropriations have gone to highways. This ultimately sets the stone for the construstion of these lanes. By limiting car usage, these appropriations can be set aside for other means of transportation. Indeed in the end Vauban is correct in calling this ""smart planning"".

Now comes out the benefits everyone knows about: the environmental benefits. Smog has been one of the largest problems that is choking the people around the world. In countries such as China, it is elementary that those people as facing large amounts of smog, daily. But what may not be as common to people is that a country such as France has also started to see a similiar problem. Pollution in France is actually rivaled by Beijingone of the most polluted countries in the world as reported by the Chicago tribune on 2014. Cars have been the major cause of this, considering the fact that a large amount of carbon emission were sent out by cars. In fact an article named ""The end of car culture"" states that cars are one of the highest sources for carbon emissions. By limiting car usage, cities such as Bogota and Paris, faced amazing results. Overall by limiting car usage the environment benefits exponentially.

In the end the solution to the people choking in the world, is simple: limiting car usage. The advantages of this limitation can be seen with benefits to socitey. This can be seen with public benefits, cheaper and time saving methods and of course the environmental benefits.",human_written
"Dear Senator, The topic of the Electoral college is a hot one, and the idea of whether of not to adjust it is controversial. Many citizen disagree with the process while many are in favor. What should we do? We should change the Electoral College. The voting is based more on quantity instead of quality, and the voting is not coming from the citizen's directly, making the risk of an unfaithful candidate too high and the actual voting less popular and more electoral. When one stateor even one person could change the whole ball game that is the Presidential Election, then what does that mean for our democracy?

While many will argue that it is a fair way to vote, the Electoral College has many flaws. First off, the candidates are focusing on more power and higher tallying states to get them through the election than everyone as a whole. For example, if you were a presidential candidate would you spend more time trying to sway California, with its whopping 55 electoral votes, or montana, with a teeny tiny 3 electoral votes? The candidates are not being considerate of ALL the American citizens, but instead the ones that they think will lead them to victory. This is not what the election is all about. The election is more focused on the popular vote of few states with many inhabitants than it is on many states with few citizens.

""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" As stated in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" . Being that this true, why do we call it the ""Presidential Election"" instead of the ""Electors Election?"" Electors claim to be faithful to their candidates but sometimes this is not the case. If a member of the group is unfaithful to their candidate, it could unsettle the whole election, meaning that the United States as a whole would have to pay for the electors actions. This is not how voting was meant to be. Our slogan is ""We the People,"" not ""We the Electors."" Now, I know what you're thinking, ""Why would we change this system? It is already established and has worked for many years."" In order to move forward as a nation we as a whole need to make changes sometimes. Just think what it would be like today if segregationan established rule and law was not questioned. Or even if the settlers of the United States had not questioned our former mother country and broke away. We would not even be the establishment we are today if we did not question established rules or traditions. The Electoral College is nothing more than a system that needs to be reevaluated, putting the popularity if the candidate in clearer perspective.

To recap, The Electoral College does not include the popularity of the candidates over official influences. The states are not being counted equally and electors control the electon overall. In order to have a more successful government and a more included population, the Electoral College simply needs to be reevaluated and changed to meet the popularity standards of our country if we are to ever advance.",human_written
